## Show Case

This is a repo with a few projects that I built while trying to learn ML & Data pre processing.

1. [Image classifier](https://github.com/natnaelabay/ml-projects/tree/main/Image%20classifier): In this project I tried to build an image classifier given an xray image of a lung it would classify it as Covid, Normal, Pneumonia. I have also built a small mobile app that acts as an interface for using the model.

2. [The second folder](https://github.com/natnaelabay/ml-projects/tree/main/machine-learning-projects) is a collection of few projects that I could find in my machine I dabbled with.

3. (PyDataCleaner)[https://github.com/natnaelabay/ml-projects/tree/main/PyDataCleaner]  Project I worked on that tries to automate the data preprocessing.
